This implements title \"Function Declarations and Definitions\"
of the Google C++ Style Guide for the case where the previous
line ends with an open parenthese.
\"Current C expression\", as per the Google Style Guide and as
clarified by subsequent discussions, means the whole expression
regardless of the number of nested parentheses, but excluding
non-expression material such as \"if(\" and \"for(\" control
structures.
Suitable for inclusion in `c-offsets-alist'."
